### New Years Resolution - Be More Security Conscious

Being a web designer and all around tech nerd I have accumilated ALOT of passwords to keep track of over the years. After having one of my servers hacked a few years back I got alittle crazy with the passwords. I fashoined Divinci code like login credentails that were sure to fiol any would be hackers attempts at cracking it. It also prevented me from getting into my own sites and servers all to often as well. Effective, yes, efficient....not so much. So what solution to try?

### 1Password Iphone App Testdrive

<http://Agilebits.com> has had this on the market for quite sometime now, however recently they added support for syncing with dropbox. This I like. So say my Iphone decides to take a dip in the lake this next summer, all my password data will be living save and sound in the cloud residing in a folder structure called agilekeychain.

So far so good, now I just have to get going adding all these passwords and notes into it. That might take awhile, but it will save me time in the long run for sure.
