### Origins
My name is Josh Howenstine, I am the owner of the Graphic Rustication Company. Originally started in Irvine, CA by my father Charlie Howenstine in the 1970's. Quickly GRC became known for unmatched quality and creativity that pushed the envelope of what many had previously conceived as multimedia commercial design. Graphic Rustication Co. now operates in Placerville, CA. We produce highly functional graphics, signs, and web interfaces. With my fathers incredible craftsmanship and knowledge and my web and graphics expertise, the new GRC is a blending of old timeless techniques with new technology and tools.
### Web Development
During the late 90's the web began to take hold on the world. In 2002 I decided that I needed a website for my automotive performance business. Money was short being young business owner so I decided to buy a book and set out to build it on my own. Immediately I was hooked on web design. Reading as many of the most current books, and blog entries on the subject I soon started to scour the web for the only the best sites. Like many others I was inspired by the csszengarden. Pure css and html, no table layouts, just clean and simple design.

The web now seams to change everyday, so keeping up can be tough. But it doesn't bother me, I love it! I get the opportunity to work with interesting people in all kinds on lines of work. Have brainstorming sessions with them about their websites and marketing strategy. Then untimely I get to create a beautiful, functional web interface that works for their company and needs.
