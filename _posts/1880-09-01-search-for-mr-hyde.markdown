I have just started to dig into Jekyll and so far **I love it!**. Fast, efficient, and only what I need for most sites. Attached to [http://github.com](My Github Account) I can easily make changes in markdown and do a simple git push. Using a git url hook I then touch the file on my production server that executes a git pull and merges the branch. Performance? It's just html files, thats the beauty of it all. Use it like a blog, and still export it as plain, stable, secure, hyper text markup.

Now it looks pretty basic in it's current state, however I will be implementing a responsive design that I have been dreaming up soon. Beautiful responsive design, fun stuff. Can't wait.
