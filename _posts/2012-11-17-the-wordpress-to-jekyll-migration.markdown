title: Migrating to Jekyll from Wordpress
date: November 17, 2012

Always on the lookout for ways to improve my websites and workflow I stumbled upon a ruby based framework called Jekyll. First of all by no means is this a brand new release. 
`code(Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.)`
