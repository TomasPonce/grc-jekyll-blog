		<h3>About Us</h3>
	      <p>The Graphic Rustication Company was originally starting in Irvine, CA by my father in the 1970's. Quickly GRC became known for unmatched quality and creativity that pushed the envelope of what many had previously conceived as multimedia commercial design. I revived the Graphic Rustication Co. to create a beautiful, and highly functional graphics, signs, and web interfaces. A blending of old lost techniques with new technology and tools. </p>
	<p>Located at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, we love to balance technology with nature. It is one reason that you will find a subtle unique texture and style in every project that we produce. Please <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a> to discuss your needs. We look forward to working with you to make your dreams a reality.
